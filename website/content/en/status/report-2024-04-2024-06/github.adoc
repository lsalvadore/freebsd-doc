The FreeBSD Project has been trying an experiment to accpet contributions via github pull requests.
We've leared a lot in the last year that we've been doing this.
We've created a number of rules relating to the pull requests.
In general, pull requests should only be for things that are user-visible, add value to the project and are ready to go, modulo final review.

At this point, we're able to keep up with the pull requests doing everything by hand.
This has proven to be tedious and error prone.
While the vast majority of the pull requests have been fine, but we have introduced a few problems.
We've started working on scripting to automate staging and landing in the tree.

We need help with automating the process:
* Adding the ability to batch multiple pull requests
* Add automated testing that's context specific (eg, run igor over man pages)
* Add build/install tests that test boot the resulting image
* Integrate CI we currently do post-commit so we can do it before for these changes.

We are coordinating on FreeBSD's Discord in the #githib-hacking channel.

Once we have things finded tuned, we'll be looking to expand this by doing publicity to steer contributors to at least the base system to github.
We'll also need more developers to review and land pull requests once it's automated that the automation has matured.
We sincerely hope that we can improve the FreeBSD contribution experience with this, as well as gain useful fixes from the community.
