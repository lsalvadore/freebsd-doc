== Abstract

[.abstract-title]
The release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} contain a summary of the changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the {releaseBranch} development line.
This document lists applicable security advisories that were issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the FreeBSD kernel and userland.
Some brief remarks on upgrading are also presented.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent}.
It describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD.
It also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents the latest point along the {releaseBranch} development branch since {releaseBranch} was created.
Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[].

The {releaseType} distribution to which these release notes apply represents a point along the {releaseBranch} development branch between {releasePrev} and the future {releaseNext}.
Information regarding pre-built, binary {releaseType} distributions along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[].

This distribution of FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} is a {releaseType} distribution.
It can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/[] or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) {releaseType} distributions of FreeBSD can be found in the link:{handbook}/mirrors[Obtaining FreeBSD appendix] to the link:{handbook}/[FreeBSD Handbook].

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing FreeBSD.
The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information discovered late in the release cycle or after the release.
Typically, it contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to documentation.
An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in FreeBSD since {releasePrev}.
In general, changes described here are unique to the {releaseBranch} branch unless specifically marked as MERGED features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued after {releasePrev}, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.
They may also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering practices.
Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural improvements.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported using the man:freebsd-update[8] utility.
See the release-specific upgrade procedure, link:../installation/#upgrade-binary[FreeBSD {releaseCurrent} upgrade information], with more details in the FreeBSD handbook link:{handbook}cutting-edge/#freebsdupdate-upgrade[binary upgrade procedure].
This will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official FreeBSD release.
The man:freebsd-update[8] utility requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according to the instructions in [.filename]#/usr/src/UPDATING#.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up _all_ data and configuration files.

[[userland]]
== Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications, contributed software, and system utilities.

[[userland-config]]
=== Userland Configuration Changes

By default, changes shown in email by the man:periodic[8] facility from the `daily` scripts show less context than before to reduce the size of the output.
The behavior can be controlled by the `daily_diff_flags` variable in man:rc.conf[5].
Similarly, the changes shown by the security scripts show less context than previously, controlled by the `security_status_diff_flags` variable in man:rc.conf[5].

[[userland-programs]]
=== Userland Application Changes

The man:date[1] program now supports nanoseconds.
For example: `date -Ins` prints "2024-04-22T12:20:28,763742224+02:00" and `date +%N` prints "415050400".
gitref:eeb04a736cb9[repository=src]

The man:lastcomm[1] utility now displays timestamps with a precision of seconds.

The man:ldconfig[8] utility now supports hints files of either byte order.
The default format is the native byte-order of the host.
gitref:fa7b31166ddb[repository=src]

OpenSSH has been upgraded to version 9.7p1.
Full release notes are at https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.7[] and https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.6[] .
gitref:a25789646d71[repository=src], gitref:464fa66f639b[repository=src] (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The man:sendmail[8] suite has been upgraded to version 8.18.1, addressing CVE-2023-51765.
gitref:58ae50f31e95[repository=src]

The man:usbconfig[8] utility now reads the descriptions of usb vendor and products from [.filename]#/usr/share/misc/usb_vendors# when available, similar to what man:pciconf[8] does.

[[userland-contrib]]
=== Contributed Software

One True Awk (man:awk[1]) has been updated to 2nd Edition, with new -csv support and UTF-8 support.
gitref:7b9a772f9f64[repository=src]

[[userland-deprecated-programs]]
=== Deprecated Applications

[[userland-libraries]]
=== Runtime Libraries and API

The man:setusercontext[3] routine in `libutil` will now set the process priority (nice) from the [.filename]#.login.conf# file from the home directory under appropriate conditions, as well as the system man:login.conf[5].
The priority can now have the value `inherit`, indicating that the priority should be unchanged from that of the parent process.
Similarly, the umask can have the value `inherit`.

[[kernel]]
== Kernel

This section covers changes to kernel configurations, system tuning, and system control parameters that are not otherwise categorized.

[[kernel-general]]
=== General Kernel Changes

The `fpu_kern_enter` and `fpu_kern_leave` routines have been implemented for powerpc, allowing the use of man:ossl[4] crypto functions in the kernel that use floating point and vector registers.
gitref:91e53779b4fc[repository=src]

[[drivers]]
== Devices and Drivers

This section covers changes and additions to devices and device drivers since {releasePrev}.

[[drivers-device]]
=== Device Drivers

Multiple PCI MCFG regions are now supported on amd64 and i386, allowing PCI configuration space access for domains (segments) other than 0.
gitref:4b5f64408804[repository=src]

The man:smsc[4] Ethernet driver can now fetch the value of `smsc95xx.macaddr` passed by some Raspberry Pi models and use it for the MAC address.
It always uses a stable MAC address even if there is no address in EEPROM.
gitref:028e4c6548e4[repository=src]

[[drivers-removals]]
=== Deprecated and Removed Drivers

[[storage]]
== Storage

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other storage subsystems, both local and networked.

[[storage-general]]
=== General Storage

[[storage-nfs]]
=== NFS

New man:sysctl[8] variables have been added under `kern.rpc.unenc` and `kern.rpc.tls`, which allow an NFS server administrator to determine how much NFS-over-TLS is being used.
A large number of failed handshakes might indicate an NFS confirguration problem.
